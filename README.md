# Istia Rover
This branch repository contains the ROS package used on the Cerema steering rover. It is un update

To sum up the differences betwee the master branch and the erle_rover branch is that the motor_hat node has been update to be able to control the driver wheels and the steering wheels, and all the unecessary scritps has been remove.
